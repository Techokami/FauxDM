CHANGES SINCE BUILD 01
======================

GAMEPLAY CHANGES:
- Added the ability to customize the initial frag count, and how much it increases
  every time a level is completed, via the DM Sim menu.
- Added a "time extension" that increases your starting time every time a number
  of maps is completed. The amount and intervals between increases can be customized
  in the DM Sim menu.

WEAPON CHANGES:
- Replaced the ever-useless Pistol with the Machinegun
- Renamed the Machinegun sprites to avoid sprite conflict with other mods
