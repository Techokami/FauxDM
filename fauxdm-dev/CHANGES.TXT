NEXT VERSION
============

MONSTER CHANGES:
- General: Monsters can now trigger "Sector Action: Actor Hits Floor" actors that
  are set up to be effected by players, since these are commonly used to kill or
  teleport players that go out of bounds. This is, of course, togglable in the
  DM Sim menu.
  
ITEM CHANGES:
- Fuel Canister: New pickup sound.
  
MISC. CHANGES:
- Renamed explosion sprites to avoid sprite conflict with custom mapsets.
- Removed duplicate Rocket Launcher sprites.
- Explosive Barrels now have their original delay before exploding.
- Timer is no longer visible when HUD is disabled.
- Converted Jimmy's smallfont to the modern Unicode font format, making it play
  nicer with custom mapsets that override the smallfont.
- Respawn/Teleport fog looks a little nicer, and has a different sound when
  teleporting instead of respawning.
