 The To-Do List

================================================================================

MONSTERS:
- Navigation is kind of fucked. They're never, _ever_ going to be trying to be
  proper bots (they're idiot monsters that think they're people!) but it'd be
  nice if they didn't just "run the rope" between walls as much.
  
GAMEPLAY JUNK:
- ACS should probably be de-fucked and ported to ZScript, but that stuff is
  pretty scary, so it's ACS for now. _For now._
- Skill settings need implementing. Prob. once more stuff is added.
  
MAPS:
- FDM02 could use further tweaking.
- FDM04 needs more actors and additional STUFF in the outside bit.

 The Will-Do In The Future List

================================================================================

MONSTERS:
- Add more monster types! And then add more! AND THEN MORE.
- Find a way to fake obituaries when killed, using player name and monster name.
  Yes, this would be spammy. No, I don't care.
- Maybe some fake text chat every now and then?

WEAPONS:
- Add replacements for Skulltag BFG10k
- Make the Grenade Launcher's grenades more like the Quake GL's

MISC:
- Make the win/lose intermission pics script better handle non-320x240 resolutions.

 The Can't-Do List
 
================================================================================

- Even though they basically aren't used by the mod, maps still require a Player
  1 start to load. This rules out some Deathmatch map sets unless you manually
  add a start position in an editor. Which isn't HARD, but it can be tedious.
- The LevelCompatibility script to make multiplayer weapon spawns appear mangles
  spawn flags, causing script-triggering actors like SecActHitFloor to have
  incorrect settings. As such, this is locked behind a CVar until engine-side
  functionality emerges to fix this.
