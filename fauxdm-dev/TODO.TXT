 The To-Do List

================================================================================

MONSTERS:
- Navigation is kind of fucked. They're never, _ever_ going to be trying to be
  proper bots (they're idiot monsters that think they're people!) but it'd be
  nice if they didn't just "run the rope" between walls as much.
  
WEAPONS:
- Add replacement for Skulltag BFG10k
- Maybe one or two more after that?!
  
GAMEPLAY JUNK:
- ACS should probably be de-fucked and ported to ZScript, but that stuff is
  pretty scary, so it's ACS for now. _For now._
- Skill settings need implementing. Prob. once more stuff is added.

MISC. NONSENSE:
- Add GLDEFs definitions to everything.

 The Will-Do In The Future List

================================================================================

MONSTERS:
- Add more monster types! And then add more! AND THEN MORE.
- Find a way to fake obituaries when killed, using player name and monster name.
  Yes, this would be spammy. No, I don't care.
- Maybe some fake text chat every now and then?

WEAPONS:
- Make the Grenade Launcher's grenades more like the Quake GL's

MISC:
- Improve how the intermission win/lose backdrops are drawn to match how the
  engine draws the real backdrop.

 The Can't-Do List
 
================================================================================

- Even though they basically aren't used by the mod, maps still require a Player
  1 start to load. This rules out some Deathmatch map sets unless you manually
  add a start position in an editor. Which isn't HARD, but it can be tedious.
- The LevelCompatibility script to make multiplayer weapon spawns appear mangles
  spawn flags, causing script-triggering actors like SecActHitFloor to have
  incorrect settings. As such, this is locked behind a CVar until engine-side
  functionality emerges to fix this.
