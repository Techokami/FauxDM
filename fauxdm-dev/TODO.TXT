 The To-Do List

================================================================================

MONSTERS:
- Navigation is kind of fucked. They're never, _ever_ going to be trying to be
  proper bots (they're idiot monsters that think they're people!) but it'd be
  nice if they didn't just "run the rope" between walls as much.
- Add more monster types! And then add more! AND THEN MORE.
  
WEAPONS:
- Add replacement for Skulltag BFG10k
- Maybe one or two more after that?!
  
GAMEPLAY JUNK:
- ACS should probably be de-fucked and ported to ZScript, but that stuff is
  pretty scary, so it's ACS for now. _For now._

MISC.:
- Add the fake voice chat system!
